If you want Steam in your living room, you need GamerOS.

## Features

### ● minimal
only what you need to play games and nothing more

### ● always up to date
regular updates delivering the latest drivers and software for an optimal experience

### ● zero downtime updates
fully automatic updates that run in the background without disrupting gameplay ([more info](https://github.com/gamer-os/frzr))

### ● controller first
fully controller compatible interface with no mouse or keyboard required (but you can still use a mouse and keyboard if you want to)

### ● use any controller
support for Xbox 360, Xbox One, DualShock 3 & 4, Switch Pro, Steam controllers and more (compatibility varies by game)
